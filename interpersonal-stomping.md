# Interpersonal stomping as a male kinda-western critique

so like, not everyone does this, obviously, and like, 
its a common enough pattern of behaviour that I'm provoked with enough to want to talk about it

I speak in a considerably softer means than most people in the groups I'm a part of, 
people in the groups I'm in are more loud than me in the way they speak

I find myself often, in slightly heated discussions, overtalked severly, people take advantage of the fact that I speak softly
to refuse to listen to my viewpoints at all, or they often just keep talking and going on without interrupting and sometimes,
and like, kinda rarely, but like some people only talk when I attempt to respond

I also, like, idk if this is a me thing, but I often need more time to think before I speak,
despite my english being better than most individuals in my surroundings, I'm also not as good with it as other people from
native-english speaking countries,
I feel like I take time to harmonize my thoughts
so I take pauses and take time to respond,

kinda messes conversations up so much, I'm not given time to speak, and like when I say "I need some time to think about this",
I've at least in one instance had someone shout at me for refusing to just accept what they said

I've often heard the response and justification for speaking harshly to people that,
"people deserve to feel hurt and harshly spoken to and know what I feel, so that they recognize what they're doing wrong and change their behavior"
but it feels like people do that in rather benign conversations all the time

and what's frustrating is that - people in the west tend to do this to each other too so fucking much, its not like something I've seen exclusively
happen to people of color, I noticed an older gentleman refused to be given an opportunity to speak at all and constantly overtalked yesterday
which provoked me enough to want to write this blog post

it feels like the only way I can get my viewpoints heard is to speak louder, and it totally works, but its just exhausting and idk I feel like like 
like sometimes I just feel like a considerably weaker person than most people, idk, maybe I am,

conversations with women and woman majority groups feel much safer and so much more real, idk,
it didn't happen as much in a the knitting group I used to be a part of, again over discord, despite still lacking people of color,
but it felt like I could say things and be heard, people would actually give fruitful responses, I didn't feel stomped over

there's also this really freaking annoying thing like, I know I speak english differently, I know I roll my r's constantly, like I pronounce words differently,
and I appriciate people pointing it out at times, because I do want to correct the way I speak, but also at other times idk it just feels like a way to dominate
over conversations idk

I've started avoiding heated conversations alot more recently because of this, or saying "lets move on to another topic" or just something to
evade discussions altogether or not speaking at all, it just feels so much better for my mental health, though,

I feel a sense of self erasure to a degree because of this
